# uuIE (MiniIE)
Show a small window of a web page.<br>
uuIE is using IE Browser as component. uuIE is developed as MiniIE, to show Web page in a small window.<br>
It can be shown always on top of other windows, and can minimize to a icon button without disturbing other windows.<br>
It is quite good to show news, weather forecast, flash games, and others in small window.<br>

How to build<br>
This is built with **ccProj**. Before building this, please download **ccProj** first, and put uuIE at the same level of ccProj project. Then you can build it from ccProj2015.sln or just click ~Compile.bat when downloaded build SDK from **ccProj**.<br>
# ccProj<br>
ccProj is a minimum C++ MFC. It is a framework for building Windows applications without 3rd run-time dll or libraries. The built release file has very small size and can run on Windows XP or even Windows NT, 98 or 95. I have maintained the project for more than 10 years and built a lot of free software with it.<br>
